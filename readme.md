# Vim Markdown

Basic markdown syntax for vim, forked from [Tim Pope's Version](https://github.com/tpope/vim-markdown).

I've added a basic preview command invoked by `<leader>p` while viewing a markdown document. The preview mode also has a button to format the page for a printer.

I use Vim for most of my writing, so I use the preview feature when I have to:

- Share something by email
- Print it for editing or offline reading

TODO:

- Basic formatting keystrokes (bold, italic, etc.)
